# Straight Talk on Social Media – Interactions and Sex Education online



Our social media presence is robust and we boast of almost fifteen thousands facebook likes on our official page and 3,500 followers on our twitter.
These social media platforms help us to interact with the youth and offer appropriate infotmation to their concerns shared on our wall.
Our Twitter Chats on SRHR issues, currently working together with Marie-Stopes Kenya, Fatuma’s Voice, Her Voice, Nimechanuka and Love matters are insightful and youth friendly in their approaches. We have tackled rape through #Endrapeke, Teenage pregnancies and STIs among the youth.
