## Straight Talk

## Our mission

We intend to contribute to combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, reduce teenage pregnancies, promote safe and responsible sexual behaviours, discourage harmful traditional practices, eliminate sexual abuse and promote gender and human rights awareness around these topics.

## Our Vision

We endeavor to provide Kenyan adolescents with a forum for open dialogue on sexuality and reproductive rights related to HIV AIDS, homosexuality, girls’ rights and more. Straight Talk started with the objective to equip young people with information and life skills so that they can protect themselves from high risk situations and remain in control of their own behaviour.
