## Straight Talk
Youth-centred adolescent sexuality and reproductive health program that incorporates a newspaper, a network of clubs, a radio/ TV show, and training programs.

## Our mission

We intend to contribute to combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, reduce teenage pregnancies, promote safe and responsible sexual behaviours, discourage harmful traditional practices, eliminate sexual abuse and promote gender and human rights awareness around these topics.

## Our Vision

We endeavor to provide Kenyan adolescents with a forum for open dialogue on sexuality and reproductive rights related to HIV AIDS, homosexuality, girls’ rights and more. Straight Talk started with the objective to equip young people with information and life skills so that they can protect themselves from high risk situations and remain in control of their own behaviour.

## What We Do
The Straight Talk project facilitates collaborative partnerships with adolescents with the aim of developing coping strategies and behavioural life skills that will help young people remain in control of their behaviour. The Straight Talk concept is built on the tenet that youth need information on sexuality and reproductive health so as to be able to make informed decisions about their health and lives.

At the core of all Straight Talk activities is youth participation as a strategy. The Straight Talk Editorial Board is comprised of 4 boys and 4 girls who meet twice per month with adults from the STFK. Along with their peers, these adolescents guide and develop Straight Talk media as part of an interactive and participatory structure has greatly contributed to its popularity.
